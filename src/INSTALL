WARNING: BETA SOFTWARE IS DANGEROUS AND CAN BREAK YOUR SYSTEM!
         Only use it if you know how to recover a frozen system, etc.


Starting with texrex-neuedimensionen, there are only the following
package types

a. binary only
b. data 

GeoLite databases by MaxMind are no longer included and have to be
downloaded from http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/geolite/. Convert
them to UTF-8 by doing

   iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 INFILE > OUTFILE


I. KNOWN PROBLEMS

1. FANN error message under Linux ("Cannot set activation steepnes",
   etc.). This is yet another locale problem. Do this (Bash variant) or
   similar to avoid annoying conversions of commas to periods etc.:
   
   > export LC_ALL=C

2. texrex does not work properly under MS Win, and it likely NEVER
   WILL. If you are an EXPERIENCED FPC developer and know Windows, get 
   in touch.

3. The FPC build system chokes on my OSX system because it tries to
   link to i386 libraries. You can solve this by passing appropriate
   values to make:

   make all OS_TARGET=darwin CPU_TARGET=x86_64

II. INSTALL and RUN

0. Make sure you have ICU 4.8 installed (binaries). ICU changes the
   C symbol names with each version, so making symbolic links from 5.2
   objects to "_48" files will not work. If this is a problem, you need
   to re-compile texrex and create a "units/icuplatform.inc" file
   containing the correct suffix (use "units/icuplatform.inc.tpl" as a
   template) before compilation. Also, you need FANN (version 2 or
   above) binaries.

1. Copy the executable files to a directory in yout %PATH% (Win) or
   $PATH (others).

2. Download the data package. Put the files wherever you want them
   and define an environment variable $TEXREXDATA to point to the
   containing folder. Document assessment (".prof") files,
   normalization files (".norm"), and deboilerplater networks (".net")
   are available for Dutch, English, French, German, Spanish, Swedish.
   Use the "Germanic" FANN for other Latin alphabet languages. I will
   NOT add support for other than Latin alphabets.

3. Download the MaxMin GeoLite City database (Legacy), convert the
   "bocks" and the "locations" file from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8, and put
   the results in $TEXREXDATA. Conversion command example:

   > iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 GeoLite.csv > GeoLiteUtf.csv

3. You can now use texrex from any folder on your system. The data
   package contains a "texrex.ini" which can be put into any project
   folder as a template for job configuration.
   
4. To run the texrex job defined in "texrex.ini" just do something like:

   > texrex -j texrex.ini
   
   - or -
   
   > nohup texrex -j texrex.ini &

5. If you run texrex in the background using nohup etc., you can talk to
   it using the texcomm protocol/client. Lookup the process ID of the
   mother texrex task by doing ($ is the texcomm prompt):

   > texcomm
   $ connect texrex <id>

   where <id> is the process ID.
